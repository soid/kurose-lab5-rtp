This is the corrected initial version of the file prog2.c for "Programming Assignment 5: Implementing a Reliable Transport Protocol" from Computer Networks book by Kurose.

See instructions [here](https://media.pearsoncmg.com/aw/aw_kurose_network_3/labs/lab5/lab5.html).

It is not a solution! Just fixed stubs ready for implementation â€“ I don't know why Prof. Kurose uploaded a file with many confusing syntax errors in C.
